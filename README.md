# Welcome to an Atlassian Deployment using CDK

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`AtlasStack`)
which contains an AWS 2 EC2s and 2 AWS RDS instances. This is for a Confluence integration and Jira Data Center implementation (standalone and not clustered)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
